when agent needs to connect to project database it should use #query tool from mcp server for postgres. agent has read-only access to database. 

if agents needs to change something in the database than it should make a script and give it to user for implementation in db.

all tables, data types and other obects related to this project are in the "app" schema. propose create/read/update/delete only for objects in "app" schema.
