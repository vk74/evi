All comments must be in English!
Every file should start with a header comment including: 
1. version number. if you update existing file, don't forget to increment file version number. Whenever possible try to increment micro part of the version unless this is really big update. Don't increment major version beyond one as it will be used in MVP version of product. We spare major version 2 for the second version which will come after MVP. 
2. short explanation of the file purpose and logic
3. mention it's a frontend or backend file and include filename (without path)
The rest part of the file should have a comment for each major function
Don't add date when the file was created
