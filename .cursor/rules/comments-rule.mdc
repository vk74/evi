All comments must be in English!
Every file should start with a header comment including: 
1. version number. if you update existing file, don't forget to increment file version number. Whenever possible try to increment micro part of the version unless this is really big update. Don't increment major version beyond 1 as it will be used in MVP version of product. We spare major version 2 for the second version which will come after MVP. 
2. short explanation of the file purpose and logic
3. mention it's a frontend or backend file and include filename (without path)
4. don't bump file version on each edit during one chat. this will sometimes cause too many intermidiate versions nobody cares about. increase file version at first edit and it will be committed after all edits are done.  
5. The rest part of the file should have a comment for each major function
6. Don't add date when the file was created
7. add changes in the header comment like in example below:
