# Path or URL to evi-install repo (for release.sh sync_version_to_install_repo)
# Copy this file to install-repo.env and set your path. DO NOT commit install-repo.env!
#
# cp deployment/install-repo.env.example deployment/install-repo.env
# chmod 600 deployment/install-repo.env
#
# Option 1: local path (both repos on disk). Absolute or relative to deployment/.
# When evi and evi-install are siblings (e.g. code/evi and code/evi-install), from
# deployment/ you need to go up twice, then into evi-install:
# Example (repos side by side):  export EVI_INSTALL_REPO_PATH="../../evi-install"
# Example (absolute):            export EVI_INSTALL_REPO_PATH="/home/user/code/evi-install"
#
# Option 2: clone by URL (CI or when you only have evi repo)
# export EVI_INSTALL_REPO_URL="https://github.com/your-org/evi-install.git"
#
# Only one of EVI_INSTALL_REPO_PATH or EVI_INSTALL_REPO_URL is used (PATH has priority).
# Uncomment and set one of them in install-repo.env:

# export EVI_INSTALL_REPO_PATH="../../evi-install"
