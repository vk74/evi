# Version: 1.2.0
# Purpose: Production deployment configuration template for evi (NON-SECRET values).
# Deployment file: evi.template.env
# Logic: User edits this file and uses it with `evictl` to render Quadlet units and proxy config.
#
# Changes in v1.2.0:
# - Added detailed info about Let's Encrypt renewal and process.
# - Clarified requirements for ports 80 & 443.
# - Simplified manual TLS instructions (relative paths).
# - Clarified "Internal" mode behavior regarding CA.
# - Expanded comments for clarity and AI-agent friendliness.
#
# ============================
# Examples of Config Scenarios
# ============================
#
# 1. Internal IP (Deployment on private network)
#    - EVI_DOMAIN=<your-server-ip> (e.g., 192.168.1.10)
#    - EVI_TLS_MODE=internal
#    -> Result: HTTPS works. Caddy generates its own internal Root CA and signs certificates on the fly.
#    -> Clients (browsers) will show a security warning because they don't trust this internal Caddy CA.
#    -> No external infrastructure is required.
#
# 2. Internal Domain (Intranet / Local DNS)
#    - EVI_DOMAIN=evi.local
#    - EVI_TLS_MODE=internal
#    -> Result: Same as above. Caddy acts as its own CA.
#    -> To remove warnings: You can install Caddy's root certificate (generated in data volume) on client devices,
#       but for simple usage, just ignoring the warning is standard practice.
#
# 3. Public Domain (Production)
#    - EVI_DOMAIN=example.com
#    - EVI_TLS_MODE=letsencrypt
#    -> Result: Valid public HTTPS certificate trusted by all browsers.
#    -> PREREQUISITE: Your domain DNS MUST point to this server's Public IP.
#    -> PREREQUISITE: Ports 80 AND 443 MUST be open and reachable on the host server from the internet.
#
#    [About Let's Encrypt]
#    - How it works: Caddy automatically contacts Let's Encrypt, proves domain ownership via HTTP (port 80),
#      and downloads the certificate.
#    - Validity: Certificates are valid for 90 days.
#    - Renewal: AUTOMATIC. Caddy renews them ~30 days before expiration without downtime. No manual action needed.
#    - Force renewal: If you need to reset, delete the 'evi_caddy_data' volume or use 'evictl' (future feature).
#
# 4. Custom Certificate (Corporate / Existing)
#    - EVI_DOMAIN=my-secure-site.com
#    - EVI_TLS_MODE=manual
#    - EVI_TLS_CERT_PATH=./fullchain.pem
#    - EVI_TLS_KEY_PATH=./privkey.pem
#    -> Instruction: Place your .pem files in the same directory as 'evictl' (e.g. deployment/).
#    -> Result: The system imports these files. Useful if you have a wildcard cert or corporate CA.

# TLS Mode:
# - "letsencrypt": Automatic public certs.
# - "internal":    Self-managed local CA in proxy container. No external CA required. Generates self-signed certs.
# - "manual":      Use your own certificates provided via paths below.
EVI_TLS_MODE=letsencrypt

# [For 'manual' mode only] Paths to your certificate files.
# You can use absolute paths or paths relative to the 'evictl' script location.
